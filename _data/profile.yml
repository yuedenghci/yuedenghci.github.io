    I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology supervised by inspiring <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~bli/" target="_blank">Dr. Bo Li</a> with the research direction of Human-Computer Interaction. During the journey, I also received wonderful and professional guidance from <a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Yixin Zou</a> in the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy.
  </p>
  <p> 
   My research lies at the intersection of <strong>human–computer interaction (HCI) </strong>and <strong>computer security and privacy (S&P)</strong>, with a focus on the understanding and intervention of digital harms in socio-technical systems. I investigate how digital harms are generated, experienced and mitigated in the digital area. I am committed to interdisciplinary work that addresses two core questions: (1) how do individuals and communities experience and respond to digital harms, and (2) how can human-centered interventions and system designs support harm mitigation and recovery? I pay particular attention to vulnerable groups, such as older adults. My work aims to design inclusive computing approaches to improve their <strong>safety, agency and digital well-being</strong>. 
  </p>

  <p>My recent work focuses on three main directions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Cybercrime Prevention and Defense</strong>:
          <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3706598.3714137" target="_blank">intergenerational support and challenges in online scam defense (CHI'25)</a> | <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12324" target="_blank">anti-scam interventions through role-based simulations (CHI'26)</a> | scam-driven human trafficking  (CHI'26) | <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16050" target="_blank">individual resilience after cybercrime (CHI'26)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Digital Harms in Online Ecosystems</strong>:
          <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3613904.3642194" target="_blank">gender debate in everyday feminism (CHI'24)</a> | <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3613904.3642194" target="_blank">overwhelmed help-seeking during crises (CSCW'22)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inclusive Computing</strong>:
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12300" target="_blank">older adults’ biometric payment experiences (CHI'26)</a> | <a href="https://collinsmunyendo.github.io/papers/2026_Oakland_Security_Advice.pdf" target="_blank">security and privacy advice in the majority world (IEEE S&P'26)</a>
